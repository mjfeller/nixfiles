Installation

To install, clone this repo to ~/.config/nixfiles

   git clone https://github.com/mjfeller/nixfiles ~/.config/nixfiles

There are several subdirectories:

'home'        holds configuration used by home-mananger.
'hosts'       holds top level entrypoints for host configuration for nixos,
              nix-darwin, and home-manager.
'overlays'    holds nixpkgs overlays for customized packages. Primarily for
              personalized suckless utilities.
system'       holds system configuration for nixos and nix-darwin.

I am also a heavy user of emacs and manage my emacs configuration through a
separate repository at https://github.com/mjfeller/emacs. I found that managing
emacs through nix configuration was not practical and have thus kept it
completely separate.
